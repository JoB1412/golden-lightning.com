                     <h1>You like to save money? So do I!</h1>
                     <p>Well you could also help save the planet while you're at it because all forms of electricity generation like plugging in any 
                         <br>electrical appliances have an environmental impact on our air, water and land, but it varies. Producing and using electricity
                         <br>more efficiently reduces both the amount of fuel needed to generate electricity and the amount of greenhouse gases and other 
                         <br>air pollution emitted as a result. Approximately 40% of global CO2 emissions are emitted from electricity generation through the 
                         <br>combustion of fossil fuels to generate heat needed to power steam turbines. Burning these fuels results in the production of carbon 
                         <br>dioxide (CO2)—the primary heat-trapping, “greenhouse gas” responsible for global warming. 
                         <br>
                         <br>
                         So, basically everytime you use an eletrical applicane it sends CO2 emission into the atmosphere. Some sunlight that hits the Earth 
                         <br>is reflected back into space, while the rest becomes heat. Greenhouse gases like CO2 prvent heat from escaping into space, warming 
                         <br>the planet causing global warming.
