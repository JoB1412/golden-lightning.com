                    <h1>Facts about Electricity</h1>
                    <p>
                            Electricity travels at the speed of light, about 300,000 kilometers per second. 
                        <br>
                        <br>LED light bulbs use about one-sixth of the electricity that conventional bulbs do, cost about a 
                        <br>quarter as much to use, and last about 40 times longer. 
                        <br>
                        <br>A typical microwave oven consumes more electricity powering its digital clock than it does heating food 
                        <br>heating food 
                        <br>
                        <br>Appliances also use electricity when they’re switched off. 
                        <br>
                        <br>Every time you open the fridge door, approximately 30% of the cold air escapes! This basically 
                        <br>leads to more power consume and a higher electricity bill. 
                        <br>
                        <br>A microwave uses about 50% less energy as compared to an oven. 
                        <br>
                        <br>Approximately, 75% of electricity used to power home electronics is consumed while the products are off. 
                        <br>
                        <br>Televisions consume a lot of energy when turned off which is used in the instant working of the T.V so we
                        <br>don’t have to wait for a minute or two for it to start soon as we switch it on. Keep them unplugged when not in use. 
                        <br>
                        <br>A single lightning bolt unleashes five times more heat than the sun  
                        <br>
                        <br>10 Google searches can power a 60-watt lightbulb  
                        <br>
                        <br>As an example of how much more efficient modern appliances are, a fridge from the 
                        <br>mid-80s, 30 years ago, used four times as much electricity as a modern one (about 1400 kWh a
                        <br>year compared to 350 kWh).  
                        <br>
                        <br>As a very rough estimate a typical NZ home with 2 adults and 2 children would consume between
                        <br>15 and 28 kWh per day.
